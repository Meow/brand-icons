# brand-icons
Just some SVG files of brand logos which weren't in Font Awesome icon set already. Mostly furry projects.

All the icon vectors are made by the author of this repository. The icons are traced over the official logos of respective websites. These logos belong to their respective websites.
These icons are primarily designed for use as website assets.

### Logos included:

- Furaffinity (furaffinity.net) - furaffinity.svg / furaffinity.png

- SoFurry (sofurry.com)
- YCH.art (ych.art)

### Why are you doing this?

I am doing this completely for free as a hobby project, for the express purpose of having visual assets for my websites when I link to other resources. I typically use Font Awesome icons, however the websites provided here lacked representation in that icon pack, which prompted me to create these assets.

### I want an icon for <website name here>!

Feel free to suggest new icons for me to make via issues section of this repository.

### Are you a website operator/owner and would like your logo removed?

**There's no need for DMCA's or other expensive legal procedures!** I am an individual doing this as a hobby, and I fully aim to comply with the wishes of copyright holders, so please simply contact me via my E-Mail at `luna [at] nighty [dot] cloud`, and explain that you would like your logo removed.
